Download Folder and Extract 'Pictures' File and move to Current Folder in MatLab

This project takes a dataset of pictures (2 pictures per 4 individuals) and compares them to each other in a 'guessing' game for the user. The program runs and randomly indexes one of the pictures from the data set and will ask the user to guess who that individual is. Then, the program will display the randomly indexed picture with the user's associated guess and show the most similar image from the dataset with the actual answer of who is in the most similar image. The program produces images of the same person about 90% of the time, but interestingly there are two different individuals that look similar enough to be associated by the program. Have fun playing and guessing which images are most similar!

In order to play the game, you must first download the code and follow the instructions regarding downloading the pictures. Open the set of code in Matlab and ensure that the folder "Pictures" is in your current directory, alongside the two sets of code. When you run the Face Recognition set of code, it will upload the pictures into database and allow you to play the game detailed above.

** We had trouble with GitHub until March 8. We met with TA's to resolve the problem and figured out the issues. As a result, our GitHub history starts on March 8.**
